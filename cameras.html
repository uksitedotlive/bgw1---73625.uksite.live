    <b>Camera Page:</b><br>
    The Camera page on The Bute Gardens West Community app provides users with access to live feeds from security cameras within the community. Users, whether logged in or not, can view publicly listed camera feeds for enhanced safety and awareness. Additionally, logged-in users have the option to contribute to the app's security network by adding their own cameras.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b></b></p><br><p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Enhanced Security:</b><br> The primary purpose of the Camera page is to contribute to the overall security of the app. By allowing users to share live camera feeds, app members can collectively keep an eye on the neighborhood, deterring potential security threats.</li>
<br>      
<li><b>Immediate Response:</b><br> In case of emergencies or suspicious activities, the app team, which includes The Bute Gardens West App Team, can quickly assess the situation through the camera feeds and take appropriate actions such as contacting the authorities.</li>
<br>      
<li><b>Community Collaboration:</b><br> The Camera page encourages a collaborative effort among app members to actively participate in maintaining a safe and secure environment. It fosters a sense of shared responsibility for the well-being of everyone in the app.</li>
<br>      
<li><b>Privacy Control:</b><br> The app provides users with the option to control the visibility of their camera feeds. Users can choose to make their feeds public, allowing the entire app to view them, or keep them private, accessible only to The Bute Gardens West App Team. This ensures a balance between app surveillance and individual privacy.</li>
<br>      
<li><b>Emergency Response Coordination:</b><br> In critical situations, the app team can coordinate with camera owners to obtain recorded footage for further investigation or as evidence for law enforcement, if necessary.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
<br><br>
  <p>
    <b>Adding a Camera:</b><br>
    you don't need to be logged in to add a camera. Simply click the "Add a Camera" button and provide the following information:
</p><br> <p>   
<ul>
      <li><b>Name:</b> <br>Provide your name so that the app team can address you and alert you if necessary.</li>
<br>      
<li><b>Email:</b> <br>Your email will be used to add you to the account system. Once added, you can log in using your email. During the camera addition process, you will receive a temporary password that you'll need to change later.</li>
<br>      
<li><b>Phone Number:</b> <br>Providing your phone number enables quicker communication in case of incidents. The app team may contact you by email and/or phone when an incident is reported around your address.</li>
<br>      
<li><b>Address:</b> <br>Enter the address of the camera so that the app team knows where it's located. This allows them to inform you of incidents within your area using email and/or phone.</li>
<br>      
<li><b>RTSP Streaming URL:</b> <br>Add the RTSP Streaming URL of your camera(s). You can add up to 4 cameras at a time. The RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol) is used to provide the live feed from the camera. If you need help finding your camera's RTSP URL, you can use <a href="https://at.this/link/rtsp/urls">this link</a>.</li>
    </ul>
